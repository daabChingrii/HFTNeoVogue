- ## Wait for Pull Request to merge ‚è≥‚è≥

- ## Celebrate - you've done your first pull request ü•≥ü•≥!!

## HacktoberFest Guidelines to making your first PR:

```yaml

Always make more then 4 pull requests.
Lets say you have made only 4 pull request to different projects,
but one project is excluded from hackoctoberfest event then your pull request will not be counted and 
then you have remaining 3 valid pull requests if these projects is not excluded.
If you fail to make 4 pull requests then you can't get digital-swags.
I will recommend you to make pull request to your own repo which is very very safest side for you..
keep in mind that repository has hacktoberfest topic..

```

```yaml

PR/MRs that are labeled with a label containing the word ‚Äúspam‚Äù by maintainers will not be counted.

```

```yaml
HacktoberFest uses the Node.js 18 RegEx engine with /\bspam\b/i to look for spam labels.
PR/MRs that also have the ‚Äúhacktoberfest-accepted‚Äù label cannot be marked as spammy via a label.
PR/MRs that have been merged and do not have a label containing the word ‚Äúinvalid‚Äù cannot be marked as spammy via a label.
PR/MRs that the system detects as spammy will also not be counted.

Any user with two or more spammy PR/MRs will be disqualified.

Remember: Quantity is fun, Quality is key.

```
