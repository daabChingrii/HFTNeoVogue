# HacktoberFest: NeoVogue
“Fast Fashion” is the quick production of cheap and trendy clothes that prioritizes meeting consumer demand for the latest styles. Fast Fashion brands are known for designing and bringing new clothing to the market in a matter of a few weeks. These retailers frequently update their inventory to keep up with seasonal and trend-driven fashion changes. This means that they often have new collections or items available for purchase every few weeks.

NeoVogue is a website that collaborates with Designers, Developers, and Content Creators alike.

## HacktoberFest Guidelines to making your first PR:
PR/MRs that are labeled with a label containing the word “spam” by maintainers will not be counted.

HacktoberFest uses the Node.js 18 RegEx engine with /\bspam\b/i to look for spam labels.
PR/MRs that also have the “hacktoberfest-accepted” label cannot be marked as spammy via a label.
PR/MRs that have been merged and do not have a label containing the word “invalid” cannot be marked as spammy via a label.
PR/MRs that the system detects as spammy will also not be counted.

Any user with two or more spammy PR/MRs will be disqualified.

Remember: Quantity is fun, Quality is key.
